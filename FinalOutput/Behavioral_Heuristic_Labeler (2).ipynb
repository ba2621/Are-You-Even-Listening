Under 100 words is a good title length.\\n\\n[EX Q]: Influenza A virus (IAV) is a major cause of respiratory illness. Given the disease severity, associated economic costs, and recent appearance of novel IAV strains, there is a renewed interest in developing novel and efficacious \"universal\" IAV vaccination strategies. Recent studies have highlighted that immunizations capable of generating local (i.e., nasal mucosa and lung) tissue-resident memory T and B cells in addition to systemic immunity offer the greatest protection against future IAV encounters. Current IAV vaccines are designed to largely stimulate IAV-specific antibodies, but do not generate the lung-resident memory T and B cells induced during IAV infections. Herein, we report on an intranasally administered biocompatible polyanhydride nanoparticle-based IAV vaccine (IAV-nanovax) capable of providing protection against subsequent homologous and heterologous IAV infections in both inbred and outbred populations. Our findings also demonstrate that vaccination with IAV-nanovax promotes the induction of germinal center B cells within the lungs, both systemic and lung local IAV-specific antibodies, and IAV-specific lung-resident memory CD4 and CD8 T cells. Altogether our findings show that an intranasally administered nanovaccine can induce immunity within the lungs, similar to what occurs during IAV infections, and thus could prove useful as a strategy for providing \"universal\" protection against IAV.\\n[EX A]: a section of the journal Frontiers in Immunology Polyanhydride Nanovaccine Induces Robust Pulmonary B and T Cell Immunity and Confers Protection Against Homologous and Heterologous Influenza A Virus Infections\\n\\n[EX Q]: We have previously reported that the apathogenic Tula hantavirus induces apoptosis in Vero E6 epithelial cells. To assess the molecular mechanisms behind the induced apoptosis we studied the effects of hantavirus infection on cellular signaling pathways which promote cell survival. We previously also observed that the Tula virus-induced cell death process is augmented by external TNF-. Since TNF- is involved in the pathogenesis of hantavirus-caused hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) we investigated its effects on HFRS-causing hantavirus-infected cells. We studied both apathogenic (Tula and Topografov) and pathogenic (Puumala and Seoul) hantaviruses for their ability to regulate cellular signaling pathways and observed a direct virusmediated down-regulation of external signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) survival pathway activity, which was dramatically enhanced by TNF-. The fold of ERK1/2 inhibition correlated with viral replication efficiencies, which varied drastically between the hantaviruses studied. We demonstrate that in the presence of a cytokine TNF-, which is increased in HFRS patients, hantaviruses are capable of inactivating proteins that promote cell survival (ERK1/ 2). These results imply that hantavirus-infected epithelial cell barrier functions might be compromised in diseased individuals and could at least partially explain the mechanisms of renal dysfunction and the resulting proteinuria seen in HFRS patients.\\n[EX A]: Virology Journal Hantaviruses and TNF-alpha act synergistically to induce ERK1/2 inactivation in Vero E6 cells\\n\\n[EX Q]: High-tuberculosis (TB)-burden countries are located in sub-Saharan Africa. We examined the frequency of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, followed by recombinant expression of the most frequent HLA-A alleles, i.e., HLA-A*3001 and HLA-A*3002, to study differences in mycobacterial peptide presentation and CD8 T-cell recognition. We screened a peptide library (9-mer peptides with an 8-amino-acid overlap) for binding, affinity, and off-rate of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis-associated antigen TB10.4 and identified only three TB10.4 peptides with considerable binding to HLA-A*3001. In contrast, 22 peptides bound to HLA-A*3002. This reflects a marked difference in the binding preference between the two alleles, with A*3002 tolerating a more promiscuous peptide-binding pattern and A*3001 accommodating only a very selective peptide repertoire. Subsequent analysis of the affinity and off-rate of the binding peptides revealed a strong affinity (8 nM to 7 M) and moderate off-rate (20 min to 3 h) for both alleles.\\n[EX A]:',\n",

        "\n",
        " created a fully functional Colab pipeline that established the project's **Behavioral Metric**. Specifically, I:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Implemented Heuristics:** Developed the core Python logic (`parse_length_limit`, `check_format_json`, etc.) to automatically and objectively check for compliance against our five locked constraints: `length_limit`, `keyword_X`, `format_json`, `no_explanations`, and `tone\\_concise`.\n",
        "* **Created the Scorer Function:** Designed the central function, `score_instruction_following`, which takes the prompt/answer texts and applies all relevant heuristics to produce a single, binary **instruction-following label ($\\mathbf{y}$)** (1 for compliant, 0 for violation).\n",
        "* **Validated the Pipeline:** Used a **synthetic answer generator** (`make_dummy_answer`) to intentionally test edge cases (e.g., generating invalid JSON, overly long answers). This was a critical step to prove the scoring logic works correctly *before* running expensive model inference.\n",
        "* **Generated the Artifact:** Produced the main deliverable, **`behavior_labels.csv`**, which contains the final binary label and per-constraint pass/fail flags for each example.\n",
        "* **Computed Baseline Statistics:** Calculated and visualized the preliminary compliance rates overall, by dataset, and by constraint type, confirming the output is ready for analysis.\n",

        "### 2. Why This is Crucial (Project Impact)\n",
        "\n",
        "The work established the **objective ground truth** for the model's behavior. This truth is the **outcome variable** that all other metrics will be tested against:\n",

        "\n",
        "By delivering this reliable, quantitative behavioral measure, we have provided the necessary foundation for **Week 3's Metric Computation**, where we will correlate the attention metrics (**PAM/QAM/SAM**) with this compliance score ($\\mathbf{y}$) to test our core hypotheses."
